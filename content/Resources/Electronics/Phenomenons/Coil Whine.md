**Coil Whine**, more formally **Electromagnetically induced acoustic noise** is a phenomenon that causes electronics components to emit sounds under the form of vibrations due to the electromagnetic force they're under.
Such sounds often include a soft buzz or hum.

These sounds are not harmful to the component, although they can be annoying for the end user. It can happen to computer components, more often than not to the GPU and there are some ways to mitigate it:
- Use two separate connectors from the PSU to the GPU, that should reduce the noise;
- Slightly underclock and undervolt the GPU;
- Limit FPS;

Notice: I did have coil whine with a Radeon 6700XT. Every time I scrolled with the mouse I would have this weird noise coming from the GPU, until I found out what it actually is.
