In C#, starting from .NET 8.0 it's possible to use this operator to assign a value to a variable only if it's currently null.

```c#
[RequireComponent(typeof(SpriteRenderer))]
public class MyCustomClass
{
	[SerializeField] private SpriteRenderer _spriteRenderer => _spriteRenderer ??= GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>();
}
```

In this example the code will check whether the sprite renderer is assigned via the inspector, and if not it will get the SpriteRenderer component attached to the game object.
